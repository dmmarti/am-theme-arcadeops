OVERVIEW

This ZIP package contains an Attract Mode theme to be used within Attract Mode on a Raspberry Pi.

Three background color choices.  

Theme can use MAME marquees and flyers.  Make sure to have Attract Mode configured with their paths.

For marquees and flyers, try not use to high resolution images.  They don't need to be.  Resize them smaller to have a more smooth wheel navigation.
